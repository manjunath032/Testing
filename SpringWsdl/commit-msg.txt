chore(build): keep generated JAXB sources in target; stop copying into src/generated

- Remove maven-resources copy that copied generated sources into src/generated/java
- Add /src/generated and /target to .gitignore
- Rely on build-helper to add target/generated-sources/jaxb as compile source
- Untrack generated build artifacts and build output
